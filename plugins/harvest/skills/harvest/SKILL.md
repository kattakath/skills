name: harvest
description: This skill should be used at the end of a task that produced something worth repeating — the user says "save this as a skill", "remember how to do this", "make this reusable", "turn this into an agent/workflow", "harvest this session", or a capability-broker run found a procedure, site flow or tool combination that should not be rediscovered next time. Decides the right artifact type, strips anything machine- or secret-specific, writes it in the standard format, and lands it through the operator's content repo — not as a loose file in ~/.claude.

# Harvest — turn a session's discovery into a pinned, reusable artifact

A session that figured something out (how a site's flow works, which CLI flags matter, the
order that avoids a footgun) should leave that knowledge somewhere the next session loads it.
The failure this prevents is not forgetting — it is **saving into the wrong place**: a
loose file in `~/.claude` that no repo, pin or review ever sees, and that a declarative
harness may delete on the next activation.

## 1. Worth keeping? — extract candidates, then all three must be yes

**Extract first, in this order** (from Letta Code's `reflection-v2`, Apache-2.0): what a
session teaches is usually not the procedure it set out to do.

1. **Mistakes and corrections** — what went wrong, what the user corrected, failed retries.
2. **Preferences and patterns** — conventions and workflow decisions the user made.
3. **New facts** — project, team and environment details, architectural decisions.
4. **Contradictions** — anything that conflicts with what a skill or memory already says.
5. **Reusable procedures** — multi-step workflows that may belong in a skill.

Drop anything **ephemeral** before judging it: line numbers, exact error strings, temp paths,
ports, commit hashes, one-off values. Distil the pattern, not the event ("merges armed by
`GITHUB_TOKEN` start no workflows", not "PR #7's push run was missing"); the event can go in
as the evidence for the pattern. Write relative dates as absolute ones. Across several
sessions, prefer patterns that recur, and let the latest evidence win a contradiction.

Then, for each candidate:

- **Repeats:** will this come up again (a yearly filing, a recurring migration, a tool
  used monthly)? One-off answers are not skills.
- **Hard-won:** did it take measurement, failed attempts or reading that the next
  session would repeat? Common knowledge is not worth the context it costs. The
  counterfactual test (from EveryInc's `ce-compound`): *if this were never written down,
  would the next session make the same mistake or redo the same digging?* No → drop it.
  One learning per harvest; a session with three gets three decisions.
- **Not already covered:** search where this knowledge may already be written, not just
  where skills live:
  - existing skills: the listing in context, the content repo, `find-skills`;
  - **the harness and sibling repos' own docs, ADRs, runbooks and workflow comments** —
    an operator often solved the same problem in another repo and wrote it down there
    (`gh search code --owner <owner> '<key term>'`, or `grep -ril` over a checkout's
    `docs/` and `.github/`);
  - official and community marketplaces, for an off-the-shelf equivalent.

  Found it written down? Cite and adapt it; don't rediscover it. (Missed 2026-09-23: a
  harvested skill armed auto-merge with `GITHUB_TOKEN` while the harness repo's
  `docs/auto-merge-and-merge-queue.md` already recorded why an App token is required,
  so it needed a follow-up PR.) Found it partly covered? That is an `update` or `extend`
  of the existing skill (§ 2), not a new one.

If any answer is no, say so and stop. Declining to harvest is a valid outcome.

## 2. Type — pick the artifact by what the knowledge IS

**Skills are not the default.** A fact, a preference or a correction is memory (or a hook
rule); a one-off task state belongs nowhere. Reach for a skill only for a repeatable,
multi-step procedure that clearly generalizes beyond this session.

| Knowledge is… | Artifact | Lives in |
|---|---|---|
| A procedure with steps, checks and pitfalls | **Skill** (`SKILL.md` + optional `references/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`) | Content repo, as a **one-skill plugin** — see § Adapter. There is no top-level `skills/` tree |
| A role with a restricted tool set | **Subagent** (`agents/<name>.md`) | Content repo, or a plugin |
| A fan-out orchestration that worked | **Workflow** — save from `/workflows` with `s` | Project or `~/.claude/workflows/`, then the content repo |
| Hooks, commands and skills that ship together | **Plugin** | Content repo `plugins/<name>/` + marketplace entry |
| A fact about the user or a project | **Memory**, not an artifact | The memory system / project `CLAUDE.md` (`claude-md-management`'s `/revise-claude-md` drafts that diff, if installed) |
| A correction that should block an action next time | **Hook rule** | `hookify` (if installed) writes it from the conversation; else a plugin hook |
| Specific to one repo | **Project config** | That repo's `.claude/`, never the global set |

Choose a plugin only when there is a hook or command that must travel with the skill.

**For a procedure, pick exactly one operation**, preferring to modify over creating:

| Operation | When |
|---|---|
| `update` | An existing skill covers it, but a step is wrong, dangerous or outdated. Fix that step in place; keep the rest. |
| `extend` | An existing skill covers a similar workflow; this is a new variant or edge case. Add a section, don't duplicate. |
| `deprecate` | An existing skill is obsolete, harmful or replaced. Add `deprecated: true` (and `replaced_by: <name>`) to its frontmatter with a note at the top; `skill-curator` retires it from the harness. |
| `split` | One skill has drifted into two distinct procedures and that hurt this session. Rarely. |
| `create` | Genuinely novel, with concrete commands and values, and nothing covers it even partly. |
| `none` | One-off, trivial, informational, already covered, or better as memory. |

Tie-breakers: unsure between `create` and `none` → `none`. Unsure between `create` and a
modify operation → the modify operation.

**Contradictions are fixed at the source.** When a learning contradicts a skill or memory,
correct the stale text where it lives; never append the new version alongside the old.

## 3. Clean — make it portable before writing a line

Remove or generalise, in this order:

1. **Secret values** — never copy a token, key or password; name the credential and where
   it is read from (Keychain entry name, env var name).
2. **Personal data** — account numbers, addresses, anything about third parties.
3. **Machine paths** — `/Users/<name>/…` becomes `$HOME`/XDG or a placeholder.
4. **Session noise** — dead ends go into one "pitfalls" line each, with the measured
   reason; the narrative of the session does not go in at all.

## 4. Write — the standard shape

Frontmatter: `name` (kebab-case, matches the directory), `description` (third person,
quoting the phrases a user would actually say, so the skill triggers on them), `version`.

Body, kept under ~500 lines with detail pushed into `references/`:

- **What and when** — two sentences.
- **Steps** — numbered, each with the check that proves it worked.
- **Human gates** — auth, money, irreversible steps, stated where they occur.
- **Pitfalls** — measured, dated where the date matters ("as of 2026-09").
- **References** — official docs and the source that supplied each non-obvious claim.

Re-read the description against the original request: would this session have triggered it?

Before landing, check:

- **No near-duplicate:** for a `create`, scan the skill list once more; a partial overlap
  you missed means `extend` instead.
- **Companion files exist:** every `scripts/`, `references/` or `assets/` path the
  `SKILL.md` names is really there.
- **No stale references:** after a `deprecate` or `split`, nothing (other skills,
  `index/routes.json`) still points at the old name or path.
- **Nothing ephemeral leaked:** no timestamps, hashes, ports, usernames or one-off paths.

**Drafting and testing — hand off to `skill-creator`** (`claude-plugins-official`) when it is
installed, rather than hand-rolling the checks. Harvest decides *whether*, *what type*,
*what to strip* and *where it lands*; skill-creator owns *does it work*:

- write 2–3 realistic test prompts from this session (the request that started it is the
  first) and run its with-skill / without-skill evals;
- run its description optimization, so the skill triggers on the phrases users actually
  say, not the ones the author guessed;
- its `quick_validate.py` checks the frontmatter.

Its evals and optimization loop call `claude -p` repeatedly and cost tokens: worth it for a
new skill, skip for a one-paragraph pitfall added to an existing one.

## 5. Land — through the operator's rail

**Detect the harness first** (as in `capability-broker`): if `~/.claude/settings.json`
resolves into a store, skills are declared, not dropped into `~/.claude/skills`.

**With a declarative harness — two PRs, in order:**

1. **Content repo PR** — add the plugin and its marketplace entry on a branch; one PR per
   artifact; title and commit style follow that repo. A lone skill is still a plugin: there
   is no top-level `skills/` tree to drop one into.
2. **Harness PR, after (1) merges, for a NEW artifact only** — enable it. If the harness
   registers the content repo as a git marketplace with auto-update, that is one line (the
   plugin's name in the enabled list) and no pin bump; run the harness's own checks before
   opening it. A change to an artifact that is already enabled needs no harness PR at all:
   the marketplace's auto-update delivers it.

**(2) IS THE STEP THAT GETS SKIPPED.** Measured on this fleet 2026-10-02: **five** plugins
were merged into the content repo and enabled nowhere — `prior-art-recon`,
`foundation-audit`, `mac-app-send`, `empire`, `brag-dossier`. The cost is not cosmetic: a
session that session went to use `prior-art-recon` and could not load it, because a plugin
absent from the harness list does not reach a session however green its own repo is. So
finish (2), or the artifact is shelf-ware. Check it landed by name, not by assuming:
the plugin must appear in the harness's enabled list AND in a live session's skill
listing — "declared" and "loaded" are different facts.

Until (2) activates, a new skill is not loaded globally. For immediate use in the
current project only, a copy under that project's `.claude/skills/` is acceptable if it is
deleted before the harness PR lands (two copies of one skill shadow each other).

**Without a harness:** a personal skill goes to `~/.claude/skills/<name>/`, ideally a
symlink into a version-controlled directory so it is not the only copy.

## Adapter: the kattakath fleet

| Piece | Value |
|---|---|
| Content repo | `github:kattakath/skills` (`plugins/<name>/`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) |
| Harness repo | `github:kattakath/nix-config` |
| Prior art to search | nix-config `docs/` (ADRs, runbooks), `.github/workflows/` comments, `.claude/rules/`; `gh search code --owner kattakath` |
| Delivery | git marketplace `kattakath` with auto-update: a merge to `main` ships, no pin |
| New skill | a **one-skill plugin**: `plugins/<name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `plugins/<name>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, plus a marketplace entry with `"source": "./plugins/<name>"` (never `"./"` + `strict`/`skills` — that shim is for foreign repos; see its `CLAUDE.md`). Keep the list alpha-sorted by `name`. |
| Index | a route in `index/routes.json` (goal → steps; `gap: true` if no outside source covers it), then `python3 scripts/build-index.py`. CI fails if a skill has no route. An outside source that did the job goes in `index/sources.json` instead of a new skill. |
| Enable | append the plugin name to `local.claudePlugins.marketplaces.kattakath.plugins` in `modules/shared/home.nix` |
| Harness checks | `git add -A && nix flake check`; PR title per its `pr-title` rule |
| MCP servers | never harvested here — adopted only through nix-config's `mcp-scout` |
